                            <strong>ONE PLANET ENTERTAINMENT</strong> was founded in 2015 by Endalkachew Lebeta — an accomplished actor, producer, and martial artist with an inspiring journey rooted in discipline, creativity, and passion.

                            Endalkachew’s story begins in Dire Dawa, where he began practicing Shotokan Karate at the age of seven. His dedication to the art led him to achieve the prestigious rank of 5th Dan, and he went on to represent Ethiopia in numerous international karate competitions. His martial arts career also expanded into kickboxing, where he rose to the rank of Chief Master — a testament to his commitment, skill, and leadership in the sport.
                            
                            While mastering the discipline of martial arts, Endalkachew’s creative spirit found a new calling in the world of entertainment. Blending the precision and perseverance honed through years of training, he stepped into the film industry as both a producer and actor. His unique vision and drive led to the founding of ONE PLANET ENTERTAINMENT.
                            
                            Among its proudest achievements is the production of an award-winning short film that marked a turning point for the company.
