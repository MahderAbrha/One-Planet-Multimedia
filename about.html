                            <strong>ONE PLANET ENTERTAINMENT</strong> was founded in 2015 by Endalkachew Lebeta ‚Äî an accomplished actor, producer, and martial artist with an inspiring journey rooted in discipline, creativity, and passion.

                            Endalkachew‚Äôs story begins in Dire Dawa, where he began practicing Shotokan Karate at the age of seven. His dedication to the art led him to achieve the prestigious rank of 5th Dan, and he went on to represent Ethiopia in numerous international karate competitions. His martial arts career also expanded into kickboxing, where he rose to the rank of Chief Master ‚Äî a testament to his commitment, skill, and leadership in the sport.
                            
                            While mastering the discipline of martial arts, Endalkachew‚Äôs creative spirit found a new calling in the world of entertainment. Blending the precision and perseverance honed through years of training, he stepped into the film industry as both a producer and actor. His unique vision and drive led to the founding of ONE PLANET ENTERTAINMENT ‚Äî a multimedia production company born from the desire to tell powerful, culturally resonant Ethiopian stories.
                            
                            Since its establishment, the company has played a pivotal role in shaping modern Ethiopian cinema. With over five full-length films to its name and a number of celebrated projects, ONE PLANET ENTERTAINMENT quickly earned recognition for its compelling narratives, rich cinematography, and emotionally engaging productions.
                            
                            Among its proudest achievements is the production of an award-winning short film that marked a turning point for the company. The film‚Äôs success brought national attention and solidified ONE PLANET ENTERTAINMENT‚Äôs reputation as a creative force in the industry.
                            
                            Today, the company continues to thrive ‚Äî working with both established icons and emerging talents to produce stories that honor Ethiopian heritage while pushing artistic boundaries. At the heart of it all remains Endalkachew Lebeta‚Äôs original mission: to create art that entertains, inspires, and elevates the voice of a nation.
